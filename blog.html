        <div class="date">May 21, 2024</div>
        <p>Hey! I put together some notes for myself (and maybe you'll find them handy too) on how to build a reusable frosted-glass UI panel in Godot 4.x. Everything's done through the Inspector except for the blur shader. I wanted to make something I could come back to without having to remember all the details.</p>
        <p>If you're curious, this is about creating a frosted-glass look for UI panels: clean, adjustable, and easy to reuse across different screen sizes. Hope it helps if you're working on something similar!</p>

      <h2>Everything is Figureoutable</h2>
      <div class="date">May 15, 2025</div>
      <p>At Pretty Deece Games, we live by a simple but powerful motto: "Everything is Figureoutable." This isn't just a catchy phrase – it's the core philosophy that drives our approach to game development and problem-solving.</p>
      <p>When faced with technical challenges, creative blocks, or seemingly impossible features, we don't back down. Instead, we break down the problem into manageable pieces, research, experiment, and iterate until we find a solution. This mindset has helped us overcome countless obstacles in our development journey.</p>
      <p>Whether it's implementing complex game mechanics, optimizing performance, or creating engaging narratives, we believe that with the right approach and determination, any challenge can be conquered. This philosophy not only helps us create better games but also fosters a culture of continuous learning and growth within our team.</p>
      <p>As we continue to develop our games, we'll share stories of how this motto has helped us overcome various challenges. Stay tuned for more insights into our development process!</p>
